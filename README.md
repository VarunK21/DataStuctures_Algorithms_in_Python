DataStructures and Algorithms in Python

Its an initiative by me which includes various DataStructures and Algorithms questions coded in Python 3 .
I will keep on updating the questions and various algorithms which are frequently asked in Interviews . 

# Topics -

1.) Lists (Arrays)

2.) Trees

3.) Hashmaps - 
        -> Employees under each employee
        -> Generate the entire itenary from a source to destination
        -> Array pairs divisible by k
        -> Distinct elements in window of size k
        -> Count pairs divisible by k
        -> Largest Subarray with sum 0, Contiguous subarray
